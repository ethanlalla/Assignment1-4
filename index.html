  <h1>"A Summary on <cite>The War of Art</cite>" </h1>
  <hr/>
  <p> I chose <cite>The War of Art</cite> because its all about understanding and fixing creative blocks, which I have been dealing with for years. The book really help me understand what causes resistance. </p>
  <p> Steven Pressfield's interprits an artists mental block as something he calls <i> "Resistance" </i>. He writes about resistance almost personifying it at times. Resistance is anything that can stop you from taking on a task. </p>
  <p> The book begins with a foreword written by <strong>  Robert McKee </strong>. Written in the perspective of someone who previously read the novel, Robert simplifies and helps us understands what resistance is. By telling us true stories. </p>
  <p> Resistance comes in many forms he states.<b> Procrastination </b>, is one such form. "I have an Olympic medal in <i> Procrastination </i>" Robert writes. And <b> I </b> counter that by saying I have <i>15 </i> Medals in the sport myself.</p>
  <p> "Resistance cannot be seen, touched, heard, or smelled. But it can be felt. We experience it as an energy field radiating from a work-in-potential. It’s a repelling force. It’s negative. Its aim is to shove us away, distract us, prevent us from doing our work." </p>
  <p><b> <cite> The War of Art </cite></b> spells out exactly what every individual on the planet, creative or not, has to deal with , while also providing great advice on how to recogize and combat <b> Resistance </b> </p>
  <p> <b> Steven Pressfield </b> breaks down this villain, whom holds <i> us </i> back from reaching our <strong> REAL </strong> potential. </p>
