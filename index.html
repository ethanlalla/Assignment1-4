  <h1>"A Summary on <cite>The Art of War</cite>" </h1>
  <p> Steven Pressfield's interprits an artists mental block as something he calls <i> "Resistance" </i>. He writes about resistance almost personifying it at times. Resistance is anything that can stop you from taking on a task. </p>
  <p> The book begins with a foreword written by <strong>  Robert McKee </strong>. Written in the perspective of someone who previously read the novel, Robert simplifies and helps us understands what resistance is. By telling us true stories. </p>
  <p> Resistance comes in many forms he states.<b> Procrastination </b>, is one such form. "I have an Olympic medal in <i> Procrastination </i>" Robert writes. And <b> I </b> counter that by saying i have <i>15 </i> Medals in the sport myself.
