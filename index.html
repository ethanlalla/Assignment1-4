  <p> I chose <cite>The War of Art</cite> because its all about understanding and fixing creative blocks, which I have been dealing with for years. The book really help me understand what causes resistance. </p>
  <p> Steven Pressfield's interprits an artists mental block as something he calls <b><i> <q>Resistance</q> </i></b>. He writes about resistance almost personifying it at times. Resistance is anything that can stop you from taking on a task. </p>
  <p> The book begins with a foreword written by <strong>  Robert McKee </strong>. Written in the perspective of someone who previously read the novel, Robert simplifies and helps us understands what resistance is. By telling us true stories. </p>
  <p> I found myself constantly applying what the author says in this book to myself. Being an artist I fight resistance in my creative process everytime I start a new piece. The only real way to combat Resistance is to acknowledge it's presence and choose to ignore it. </p>
  <p> Resistance never goes away, It is like that nagging wife always at the back of your ear, Whispering sentiments of self doubt. Anxiety inducing thoughts that have you doubting if anybody will even notice the work you put out. Yet this is a part of reality all us artists have to face head on </p>
  <p> You cannot outrun Resistance, because Resistance in many ways, is<b><i> You </i></b>
  <p> Resistance comes in many forms:
    <ul>
      <li><b> Procrastination </b>, is one such form. <q>I have an Olympic medal in <i> Procrastination </i></q> Robert writes. And <b> I </b> counter that by saying I have <i>15 </i> Medals in the sport myself. </li>
      <li><b> Self Doubt </b>, You want to start that business—but Resistance whispers in your ear, telling you you’re not good enough to succeed. </q>. </li>
      <li><b> Fear </b>, You want to show some work to your boss but you are afraid of it being <i>inadequate</i> and <i>lackluster</i>.
    </ul>
  <img src="images/Resistance Quote.jpg" alt="Resistance is the root of more unhappiness than poverty, disease and erectile dysfunciton" width="240" height="240"/>
  <p><q>Resistance cannot be seen, touched, heard, or smelled. But it can be felt. We experience it as an energy field radiating from a work-in-potential. It’s a repelling force. It’s negative. Its aim is to shove us away, distract us, prevent us from doing our work.</q></p>
  <p><b> <cite> The War of Art </cite></b> spells out exactly what every individual on the planet, creative or not, has to deal with , while also providing great advice on how to recogize and combat <b> Resistance </b> </p>
  <p><b> Steven Pressfield </b> breaks down this villain, whom holds <i> us </i> back from reaching our <strong> REAL </strong> potential. </p>
  <p><b> <i> Resistance speaks to us in many ways </i> </b>. Here are some examples:
    <ol>
       <li> You want to try a new hobby, but <b>Resistance</b> brings fear into your mind and it asks, <q>What if you fail, everyone will think you cannot commit to one thing.</q>
       <li> Maybe you have an assignment for a class in coding, <b>Resistance</b> might pop up and say, <q>It's laid back you can take your time, you have more important things to do. Try this another day.</q>
       <li> Maybe in that same class you feel out of your element and right on cue <b>Resistance</b> brings self doubt and says, <q> I am too stupid to understand what all the HTML things are, I dont even wanna try.</q>
    </ol>
  <p> In conclusion <i> Steven Pressfield's </i> <b> The War of Art </b> is a masterclass of knowing how to identify our <b>Resistance</b>. By showing us what to look for he shows us what to avoid interacting with when pursuing our many adventures as creatives and even as people just living everyday lives. </p>
